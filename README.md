# Saving-Superstore-Project
Saving SuperStore - I analyzed operations using data visualizations to identify profit and loss centers, assess advertising strategies, and examine product return rates. The project provided actionable insights to help the superstore make informed decisions to avoid bankruptcy and enhance profitability.
conducted a mectric to mectric analysis in which through categories of different regions and product gave a specific insight that would allow for efficient mitigation to reduce loss and maximize profits. showcased the most and least profitable products and where they were most and least profitible. showcassed on a metric of time when they would sell more product than other months in the year and what regions woud purchase at what frequency.
